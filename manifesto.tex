 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  519M isn't nothin'
 me:  the carriers are like 4 bill
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  when i worked at curtiss wright
yes
subs are 2
 me:  but this is just a shit little boat
and listen to all the development costs
and it was a current story so...
but ya its all one big fuck all
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  yeah, ridiculous
 me:  so eveyone always brings up the "well the govt dev brings about important tech advance"
rly?
like impotant advance?
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  so we spend more than the next 25 nations on defense, and 24 of em are allies
 me:  like understanding the genome further, geneomic based treatments, etc
ya
of course its just one big piece of shit
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  yeah.
ridic
 me:  so we wud have to compromise and invade only those plces where the other 24 wud also like to invade
bunch of short sighted faggots, religious faggots
just make as many bombs while ur here cus u get to chill out for eternity in heaven
as soon as im done with phd i gotta reveal my manifesto
like ppl send me articles about, "new phonon lasers"
or new this and that
and im like, whats the fucking use of any of it?
none of u have a goal in mind, ur just studying shit for

a) the sake of it, or the "fun" of it, which i dont fucking understand

b) because it helps us all live longer, better lives
b) makes more sense to me
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  lol
make ur list
everything is b)
 me:  haha
ya its a multiple choice test for scientific research dummies
ya all along i keep getting this advice, "when u give talks u come off as flat, unenthusiastic"
ya well no shit
its cus i cant just say, this is all kind of a waste of time
uve got to stab thru all the degrees of freedom and possibilities
realy define ur goal, and just slice thru right to it
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  ya it's all rorte
rote*
 me:  ya so like in ur case, i kno ur a student so i know how limiting that can be
but if u were to define ur project from the outside
u wud do the following:

a) define ur goal very clearly: we want to build a device which will allow us to diagnose issuse with walking
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  i'd prob do something neuro related
 me:  ya right
but like even with this proj
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  but ya i think even what i'm doing is a waste/will never really beu sed
 me:  like, we want to build a comprehensive framework for helping ppl with walking
ya i agree with u haha
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  but it might be useful cuz i'm doing the investigation to say hey there's nothing really here
 me:  but im trying to state a goal which is not useless
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  let's move on to the next thing
 me:  right thats a good pt
absolutely
like why do u need to take data on ppl walking?
the difference between a normal walk and a bad person is so painfully obvisou
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  lol right
 me:  u dont need to do time series analysis and all that shit
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  yep i think i said this to you few weeks ago
also for the algorithms to work, we need like 100 diff samples, not just a long time series, haha
take some 60 yr old woman with brittle bonez and parkinsons and tell her to walk around a track for 3 hours
 me:  ya so ur getting it first-hand, this bullshit pork spending which requires ppl to differentiate their research
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  and we "crunch the numbers" to determine if something's wrong
lol it's a joke
 me:  ya so in a really cut-throat darwin science world, ur project wud be terminated the second u come to this realization
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  ya
and i know what youre saying
we ought to have the kind of conversation where these priorities are kind of rising to the top
let the scientific research itself even evolve
 me:  so, ya theres just too many inefficiencies in the machinery itself, for me to rly be interested in any one problem
ya ppl are totally disengenious
because their livlihoods depends on it
just like defense contractors
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  ya
they need a raise, a promotion, etc
i think youre really talking about an issue of game theory
 me:  ya so i have been paying attn to this, and rly just rying to diversify myself and my skill set
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  each individual sees that they can easily maximize their own benefit
 me:  i want to attack this problem
ya right
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  study game theory
 me:  its def a balance
well i have seen a little bit of it
back with walter
we used to have group presenations every week on rly diverse subjects
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  kewl
 me:  this was a requirement, its how most physicists think
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  the other night, one of my old profs even confessed that he was "bitching" at us
cause he was talking about how there's just a profusion of papers out
that all talk about the same thing
 me:  ya, its rly silly

for instance, the one draft im workin on
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  again, it's rote
 me:  a group pub basically bad results in 2011
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  and it's one guy or prof who needs to get 1. more money or 2. a degree/promotion
 me:  when in 1999 a paper already covered that subject, and rly did it pretty much correctly
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  haha
 me:  and so its kinda like that plot of prgress?
u know the one where its greece, romans, dark ages, then the elightnment?
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  hahaha ya
dark ages
 me:  like half of the papers i read shud have had that work done 10-20 year prior
ya so like the dark ages rly stunted progress
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  ahuh
 me:  this is how i feel about not using open-source code/results, and not killing projects the second they become shit
it all comes back to the rate cosntant argument
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  look at the fkn arabs, they basically invented engineering and they went down the toilet
 me:  progress  = A0exp(rate*t)
ya sure, i dunno why they did that tho?
i guess just stupiod islam
but others pick up the slack so its all good
but fuck those camel fuckers
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  it's an interesting observation
like an entire group of ppl
 me:  were talkin about there here and now, and that rate constant
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  in the 17-1800s, they decided that they needed to return to "tradition"
and theyre still living in sand and murdering each other
 me:  o u mean the reformation
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  2000 years ago they were the masters
 me:  o still the arabs
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  yeah reformist muslims
 me:  u think thats gonna happen to us or something?
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  idk hard to say
but i fear that
 me:  i think were too deep into the information age for that
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  it's definitely slowed us down
 me:  i mean maybe the other faggots will do that
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  yeah but for example look at bush
rate constant
 me:  but the small science sector, theres no turning back
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  in 2001-2008
just a halt on stem cell research
 me:  right, ya the totally wrong ppl are in power
and ya totally those idiots cud ruin everything
but for the science sector
like were on the brink of finalizing the std model
theres no turning back from that
we just gotta push as fast as possible to overcome those idiots
create as large a divide as possible between us
so that they become irrelevant

like consider how much more powerful u are than someone who works at a bank
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  ya i wanna turn them into a delicious soylent green when it comes time for the show down
 me:  they can barely opreate the easy software that someone wrote for them
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  ya
well
 me:  and ppl talk about the great financial divide
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  that makes me think of that wealth inequality vid
hahaha yeah
 me:  we shud talk about the great intellectural divide
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  yes
it drops off fast
 me:  and we shud rly push as hard as we can to make it larger
cus thats the only thing thats gonna save us from religion
until theyre all in huts in the desert
literally or metaphorically
until they have no power
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  you know what else sux though
even a lot of reasonable people i know
cannot understand this conversation
lots of people are like "well you know, science has its limits"
and it's just like i wanna shake them into seeing the reality
 me:  ya its some kinda weird human thing
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  yeah
 me:  evolutionarily?
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  perhaps.
 me:  that they cant feel like anything is possible, its too hard to deal with
its a fear of failure
if u just accept that u cant do it, then it relieves u
like relogion does
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  yeah
but some of these girls i know
 me:  i struggle with this idea myself
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  what
 me:  that the only thing holding me back is my own weakness
need to sleep, to be human, etc
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  yeah
i kind of try to take comfort in that
 me:  i mean its the very thing i am criticizing others of doing too much of
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  like, being a human is a unique ride thru the universe
death is inevitable
so, i just try to appreciate what being a human "is"
 me:  thats hard to say
but ya death seems inescapable at the moment
but we have no idea the ramifications of exp
and thats kinda the thing
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  yeah. that's my "faith"
haha
 me:  like i i worked hard enuff, and evryone worked hard enuff
i think its possible to almost get rid of death

all trends point in that direction
its all about the rate constant
and so i struggle with how much i am making that bigger
and i get angry, selfishly, at eveyone who is not contriutiing to it
were very simple creatures, all driven by survival instinct
im just as elfish as the next
i just think most ppl have the wrong goal in mind, pick a religion and sit back and wait to die
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  yeah
 me:  its just like environmentalists
nobody gives a shit about the earth
they just want a safe, habitable plcee to live
if u astuaclly care about the earth, ur a fucking reatrd
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  LOL
 me:  or ur just deluding urself
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  ya that's an interesting topic too
 me:  call it whatever u want in ur mind
but u are driven by survival instinct
its why u care about ur neighbor
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  i laugh at the term "alternative" energy cause it insinuates that we'll be choosy about the energy we consume
 me:  haha,ya like Minus the Bear energy
alt-Energy
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  when you think about it, we're gonna sip up every last little drop on this bitch
 me:  ya and we shud
we have no idea if there are other intelligent beings in the uni
i think it is our duty to try and push this phenomena to the fullest
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  again, it's interesting to think about how much economic systems/game theory play in this
 me:  yes, i am intersted in how to manipulate those ideas to get what i want
u see what i mean?
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  it's kind of the basis of evolution
 me:  when u have a clear goal in mind
then there is a clear reason to care about a certain thing
like i dont want to study game theory as a rote
i want to know how i can use it to advance further the goal humanity
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  i c
 me:  the technicalities of game theory, the infomration density
is no more than some dynamical systems analysis, or the fractal beavhior of the mandelbort set, etc
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  but i think knowing about it would contribute to a fuller understanding of a lot of phenomena.
 me:  of course
i just want there to be clearly stated goals
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  cuz it is in and of itself a phenomena of scientific processes
ya
k e w l
 me:  one thing u will grab onto quickly
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  so let's build more 500 M ships to blow the shit out of brown people in countries we can't pronounce
 me:  right
ok good, i can take some things from this chat and add to my manifesto draft
so the one thing i gotta change is, i can be rly angry chatting with u
but i need to learn to make myself sterile for others
most ppl arent very angry

aschaefer257@gmail.com:  ya
 me:  and they dont wanna hear my anger
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  you know u make me think of this one chick friend of mine
she's fucking angry all the time
 me:  i need to deliver the message as vanilla as possible
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  always accusing everybody of being mysoginist, rape apologist, rapist
 me:  anger is a gift...sometimes
ya that just sounds crazy
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  well not really accusing, but her tone of her anger and her conversation is really polarizing
it's not inviting of conversation, it just encourages like "ok i can categorize you in group x that thinks y, z"
that's why i love how sam harris talks so well
model urself after him
so articulate, states the facts, doesn't really let his emotion in
but when u let it sink in it's like god damnit that guy just molded my mind
 Sent at 9:13 PM on Thursday
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  hah
sometimes i remember how u said u wish u had a clone to bounce ideas off of
i think maybe i'm the closest thing you've got? you really spitballin' here ?
 Sent at 9:18 PM on Thursday
 me:  ya thats about it
in terms of another person, our ven diagram is nearly aligned
and the anger thing, well thats the human in me
thats exactly wat im talking about
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  ya
 me:  if i cud just be more computer, less sleep
more efficeint, less emtion
but ultimately i want all these sci progress so i can be more human
more time to be human, less technology in the way, etc
so its a total fucking dichotomy
so i was thinking of having a two part manifesto
i suppose part 1 is not a manifesto, but more of a report
and the angry part is the manifesto
Reportfesto
 aschaefer257@gmail.com:  hahahaah
 me:  good thing is theres plenty of ppl who believe in the same scientific ideals
so im not alone, just need to figure out how i can contribute uniquely
